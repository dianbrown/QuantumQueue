## Features

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **FCFS** | Non-preemptive | First Come First Served - Basic FIFO scheduling |
| **FCFS Priority** | Preemptive | Priority-based with FCFS tie-breaking |
| **SJF** | Non-preemptive | Shortest Job First - Optimal for average wait time |
| **SJF Priority** | Preemptive | Priority-based with shortest job tie-breaking |
| **SRT** | Preemptive | Shortest Remaining Time - Preemptive SJF |
| **Round Robin** | Preemptive | Time-quantum based fair scheduling |
| **RR Priority** | Preemptive | Priority + time quantum scheduling |

### Page Replacement Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **FIFO** | First In First Out - Queue-based replacement |
| **LRU** | Least Recently Used - Recency-based replacement |
| **Optimal** | Farthest future use - Theoretical best |
| **Second Chance** | Enhanced FIFO with R-bit second chances |
| **Clock** | Circular buffer with R-bit sweep |

## Usage

### CPU Scheduling Practice

1. **Select Algorithm** — Choose from the dropdown (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, etc.)
2. **Generate Problem** — Click "Randomize" or enter your own processes
3. **Fill Timeline** — Click cells to schedule processes:
   - `Single Click` — Fill one time slot
   - `Double Click` — Auto-fill entire burst time
   - `Right-Click` — Add RS (Ready State) markers
4. **Check Solution** — Verify your answer against the correct solution
5. **View Metrics** — See WT, TAT, and responsiveness per process

### Page Replacement Practice

1. **Select Algorithm** — Choose FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Second Chance, or Clock
2. **Set Up Frames** — Configure frame count and initial pages
3. **Enter Page Sequence** — Type pages or use "Randomize"
4. **Arrange Queue** — Drag-and-drop frames to set initial order
5. **Solve & Check** — Mark hits/faults and verify your solution

## Tutorials

Access step-by-step tutorials from the **Help screen**:

1. Click the **Help icon** (❓) in the sidebar
2. Choose **CPU Scheduling** or **Page Replacement**
3. Select any algorithm card
4. Click **"View Example"** for an interactive walkthrough

Each tutorial includes:
- Algorithm rules and edge cases
- Randomizable practice problems
- Step-by-step explanations
- Visual queue/table updates

### Algorithm Reference

Additionally, the [Algorithm Rules](AlgorithmRules.md) document provides a detailed explanation of each algorithm's logic. Combined with the provided Python classes i created for each algorithm, it offers a comprehensive resource for understanding the implementation and applying it to your own code or programs.
